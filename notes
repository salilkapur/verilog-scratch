Verilog Notes
=============

Different between constants and parameters
------------------------------------------

* Parameters: They are usually used to store constants like time delays, bus widths etc.
* Constants: 

Blocking vs Non-Blocking
------------------------

* Use non-blocking statements in sequential logic and 
  blocking statements in combinational logic.

General Guidelines
==================

* Try to sandwich combinational logic between two registers.
  By doing so the timing analysis will constraint the combinational
  logic within one clock cycle.

* Be careful of the sensitivity list. While using always_comb
  the tool tries to infer the sensitivity list based on the assignment
  statements in the code. This might not be ideal always. At this point it
  seems better to specify the sensitivity list manually.

* It is not a good practice to put statements outside of a
  module. Use a package and import the package.
